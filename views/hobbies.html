          <h2>From a very young age I always had some extraordinary attraction to the mountains. Growing up in Colorado, my family 
            and I would always make trips to the mountains on weekends, exploring lakes and breathing the fresh alpine air. It was exhilirating
            crawling the steep dirt on all fours as a young kid. Eventually, my friends and I have completed (as of 05/57/24) 25 of Colorado's
            56 fourteeners and are aiming to finish them by our college graduation. If you're reading this I have probably attached this link to 
            some job application and I'm probably interested in working with you/at your company but feel free to contact me about mountaineering!
